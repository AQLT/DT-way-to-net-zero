abstract = {This paper compares the impact of different climate mitigation policies — mandates, feebates, performance standards, and carbon pricing — in a Ramsey model with clean and polluting capital, irreversible investment, and a climate constraint. These policy instruments imply different transitions to the same balanced growth path. The optimal carbon price minimizes the discounted social cost of the transition to clean capital, but may prompt premature retirement of existing polluting capacities and significant private costs in the form of stranded assets. Second-best mandates and feebates affect new investment decisions without providing incentives to under-use existing polluting equipment. These instruments lead to higher discounted social costs, but smoother abatement costs, and do not result in premature retirement or stranded assets. A phased-in carbon price can avoid premature retirement but still result in stranded assets, that is in a drop of wealth for the owners of polluting capital. We discuss a potential trade-off between the political feasibility and cost-effectiveness of climate mitigation policies.}

Les résultats montrent que pour la France, la trajectoire actuelle d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre n’est pas soutenable, au sens où pour atteindre l’engagement de neutralité carbone en 2050, le niveau annuel de dépenses pour le climat devrait augmenter de manière très substantielle, à 4.5 % du PIB contre 1.9 % actuellement. Ces évaluations permettent d’en déduire un prix social du
carbone, ou valeur de l’action climat, supérieures aux estimations antérieures comme celles de la commission Stiglitz-Stern, et dans la lignée des résultats de la commission Quinet en 2019. De telles évaluations de trajectoire d’émissions et de prix social du carbone pourraient constituer le point d’entrée d’une comptabilité économique environnementale qui intègre la dégradation du
patrimoine naturel induite par les activités économiques.}

 abstract = {The computation of large-scale nonlinear intertemporal optimization problems requires time-aggregation assumptions. This consists in choosing a specific gridding of the time horizon, and considering the optimal solution computed using this restricted set of dates as an approximation to the underlying continuous- or more disaggregated discrete-time formulation. A procedure generally adopted for time aggregation in applied intertemporal optimization economic models using mathematical programming techniques is shown to be inappropriate, as it introduces a dependency of the solution steady state to a specific choice of sequence of time intervals. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions to avoid this dependency, i.e., to ensure that the discretization satisfies steady-state invariance. The result is a considerable improvement in the numerical accuracy of the time-aggregated approximation. These easy-to-handle conditions are shown to apply to a broad class of models such as multidimensional intertemporal problems and endogenous growth models and may therefore prove extremely powerful in applied works such as large-scale applied general-equilibrium modeling. This conclusion is further highlighted by a comparison between this approach and a spectral-projection method using optimal orthogonal collocation as recently introduced by Judd (1992).},

We identify a set of critical methodological problems with the IAMs which limit their usefulness and discuss the analytic foundations of an alternative approach that is more capable of providing insights into how best to manage the transition to net-zero emissions.},

title = {A stock-flow consistent framework for the analysis of stranded assets and the transition to a low carbon economy.},
abstract = {This dissertation presents a stock-flow consistent (SFC) model with an integrated input-output (IO) model for the study of the economic mechanisms by which capital assets might be stranded in the fossil fuel extraction and energy generation sectors. It assesses the major macroeconomic and financial implications of both capital asset stranding in these sectors and different transitions to a low carbon economy. The model is that of a pure credit economy that consists of three firm sectors, two household sectors and a banking sector. The three firm sectors are a fossil fuel energy sector (the ‘brown’ sector), a renewable energy sector (the ‘green’ sector), and a firm sector that produces non-energy goods (the ‘other’ sector). The two household sectors are an ‘ethical’ household sector and a ‘normal’ household sector.  The model is used to investigate a number of claims from the stranded assets literature regarding the effects of different types of transitions to a low carbon economy (slow, fast, anticipated and unanticipated) and different changes in market conditions (due to changes in policy, financing conditions, technology or social norms). The results of the transition simulations support a number of the arguments made in the stranded assets literature, namely that faster transitions and unanticipated transitions are likely to strand more assets and have more disruptive effects on financial markets than slower transitions and anticipated transitions. The results of the market conditions simulations suggest that changes in market conditions that affect the real side of the economy are likely to lead to larger effects on demand and asset stranding than changes in market conditions that primarily affect firms’ borrowing costs. In addition, these simulations suggest that changes in market conditions are unlikely to have a large effect on the demand for different types of energy (and therefore on stranding) unless renewable energy becomes a close substitute for fossil fuel energy.},

We characterize the solution to the textbook Hotelling model when there is a ceiling on the stock of emissions. We consider both increasing and decreasing demand for energy. We show that when the ceiling is binding, both the low-cost nonrenewable resource and the high-cost renewable resource may be used jointly. A key implication is that if energy demand were to decline in the long run, we may supplement energy supply through ‘clean’ renewables to meet the environmental standard, but then revert back to using only ‘dirty’ fossil fuels in the future when the ceiling has become non-binding. That is, the much heralded societal ‘transition’ to clean energy resources may be short-lived.}

abstract = {The remaining carbon budget (RCB), the net amount of CO2 humans can still emit without exceeding a chosen global warming limit, is often used to evaluate political action against the goals of the Paris Agreement. RCB estimates for 1.5 °C are small, and minor changes in their calculation can therefore result in large relative adjustments. Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and present more recent data, calculation refinements and robustness checks that increase confidence in them. We conclude that the RCB for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5 °C is around 250 GtCO2 as of January 2023, equal to around six years of current CO2 emissions. For a 50% chance of 2 °C the RCB is around 1,200 GtCO2. Key uncertainties affecting RCB estimates are the contribution of non-CO2 emissions, which depends on socioeconomic projections as much as on geophysical uncertainty, and potential warming after net zero CO2.}
